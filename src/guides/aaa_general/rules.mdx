# Code of Conduct for Online Werewolf

This page is considered a living document and any member of the community is free to suggest amendments to it. We do ask that you take time to fully understand a rule is in place before challenging it. The correct place to do this is on the Discord and it should have no relation to a game currently in progress.

## Structure of this Document

There is a small set of rules that are compulsory to follow. Ignorance of these rules is no shield from the consequences, so ensure that you read and follow them to the letter at all times.

There are three principles which are fundamental to this site and its community. These principles underpin the aforementioned rules and should be followed to the spirit. The three principles are 1) Fun & Fairness 2) Respect and 3) Growth.

Finally, there is an elaboration of the principles which goes into further detail behind the rationale and motivation for the principles and rules and provides examples to illustrate the points.

## Rules

- Always play to your win condition.
- No copy/pasting/screenshots of role information, night messages or mod messages. Do not try to prove your role in a way that an evil could not bluff.
- No talking about an active game anywhere outside of the game room itself - A game moderator is the only person you may discuss an active game with.
- Do not seek to invalidate avatar-shifting based mechanics with information or tools from outside of the game.
- If you suspect a bug, message a game moderator **privately** - if they are able backfill information or remedy it they will. However, if a bug is claimed publicly within a game a moderator will not confirm nor deny it, nor will they provide missing information.
- Be active and contribute to the games that you join to the best of your ability.
- No -ist/-ic language. This includes but is not limited to racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic slurs.
- Show respect to others in the game and the community.
- Separate game-based conflict from personal conflict and congratulate a player when they beat you.

## Principles

### Fun and Fairness

The site exists to provide a place for people to play and enjoy social deduction games based on the party game Mafia. 

There is no game of Mafia if the evil players cannot deceive, manipulate and hide. If all that was required to win the game was to flip over cards, the game would not be fun. So there are rules in place to prevent good players being able to unfairly prove themselves innocent. 

A fair game is a necessary precondition for the majority of people to find it fun.

Whilst not every perosn will find the same thing fun (and that's totally okay) the players must agree what makes a game fun or there is potential to marr the experience for everyone playing.

### Respect



### Growth and Improvement
